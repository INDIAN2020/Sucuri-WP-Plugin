 Wpsyslog2 is a modification of the WPsyslog 0.1 (GPL) released by Alex G&#252;nsche ( http://www.zirona.com/software/donate ).
 We modified the code to fix some bugs, add support for Unix syslog and add a few more actions (including failed logins).

 This plugin was developed during a project with the German "Menschen f√ºr Tierrechte" (Humans for Animal Rights). This is an organisation of 
 activists who advocate animal rights and fight against abuse of animals. They generously decided to donate this work to the general public 
 by letting Zirona put it under the GNU GPL and allowing us to promote and distribute it. (In turn, we have extended it with a couple of additional features.)

 Please support the work of Humans for Animal Rights, e.g. by placing a link to [Humans for Animal Rights](http://www.tierrechte.de/ "www.tierrechte.de") and 
 spreading the word. Not (only) because of this plugin, but generally for a better treatment of the beings on this planet.
